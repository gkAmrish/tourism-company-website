    Tourists at the Temple of Apollo, Delphi, Greece. Tourism is travel for
    pleasure, and the commercial activity of providing and supporting such
    travel. The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, in
    terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited
    to holiday activity only", as people "travelling to and staying in places
    outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for
    leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes".
