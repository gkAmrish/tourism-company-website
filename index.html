  <h3><u>History of New York</u></h3>
  <p>
    The history of New York begins around 10,000 B.C. when the first people
    arrived. By 1100 A.D. two main cultures had become dominant as the
    Iroquoian and Algonquian developed. European discovery of New York was led
    by the Italian Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524 followed by the first land
    claim in 1609 by the Dutch.
